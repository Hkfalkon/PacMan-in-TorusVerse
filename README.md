# PacMan-in-TorusVerse

1.1 Background
As you know, Arcade 24TM (A24), the modern game company has been developing their new game design, PacMan in the Multiverse to provide die-hard PacMan players with something new. That version of the game adds various monsters and maze items.
However, A24 is aware that the Multiverse alone will not be sufficient to engage the die-hard players. So, while development on the Multiverse continues, A24 has engaged your team to develop an editor and test app for another variation of the game: PacMan in the TorusVerse. You will not be concerned with the changes for the Multiverse: TorusVerse will be developed based on the simple version. Then, A24 will deal with merging the MultiVerse and the TorusVerse at some point in the future.
The TorusVerse will focus more on the maps provided for the game, and included features to allow characters to, for example, exit from the left and reappear on the right (doing this left-right and top- bottom effectively makes the map a torus). Further, the game will support multiple levels so players can progress from one level to the next. To provide these maps, TorusVerse will need a map editor and tester.
